You wan't to translate DoAllWithPDF Service Menu into your language ?
You're welcome !

That will be quite long, but partial translations are welcome too. Especially the .desktop files (translate them is quick).


So in priority order, translate:
    the servicemenu files (.desktop): data/ServiceMenus/*.desktop
    the Qt translation files*       : locale/
    the servicemenu_commons file    : data/houston-servicemenu-commons/servicemenu_commons.sh
    the global script               : data/dallwithpdf_servicemenu
    

    
* TO TRANSLATE THE QT TRANSLATION FILES (in locale/):
        
        First create the file:
            Go to locale: `cd locale/`
            generate your language file: `pylupdate5 doallwithpdf.pro`
            
        Translate:
            - open the new file with QT5 Linguist
            - translate
            - save
            
when Done send me your files (on git hub, or at picotmathieu@gmail.com).
